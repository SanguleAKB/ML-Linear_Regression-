## Simple linear regression model
In this I take height-weight dataset. There are three features in my dataset but I want to train simple linear regression model so I drop one feature. Basically there are three features named as Height, Weight, Gender. 
This is 2D graph and best fit line.![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03dcb771-81b5-488f-9993-07a11332f35e)

MSE :  2.19
MAE :  1.18
RMSE :  1.48
R-Squared = 0.85
Cofficient or slope : 3.54
Intercept :  66.34
